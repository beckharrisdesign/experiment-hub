# Cursor Rules for Experiment Hub

## Log Capture
- All Next.js dev servers should output logs to `.next/turbopack.log` or a project-specific log file
- Logs should be accessible via MCP filesystem resources

## Analysis and Recommendations
- **Prefer chat-based analysis** over creating documentation files for:
  - Quick comparisons (pros/cons, approach comparisons)
  - Recommendations and decision-making
  - Exploratory analysis
  - One-off explanations
- **Use documentation files** when:
  - Information needs to be referenced later (setup guides, troubleshooting)
  - Content is part of project documentation (architecture, design decisions)
  - Multiple people need to access it
  - It's a living document that will be updated over time
- **Default to chat** unless there's a clear reason a file is needed
