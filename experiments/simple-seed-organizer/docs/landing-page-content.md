# Landing Page Content - Simple Seed Organizer

## Page Structure

### Hero Section

**Headline (H1)**:

```
Your simple seed inventory & 'use-first' list, on your phone.
```

**Subheadline**:

```
No garden planning. No calendars. Just store your seed info and get it back when you need it.
```

**Primary CTA Button**:

```
Get Early Access for $12/year
```

_(This is the "fake buy" button that leads to interest form)_

**Secondary CTA** (optional):

```
Learn More ↓
```

_(Scrolls to problem section)_

---

### Problem Section

**Section Headline**:

```
Stop rebuying seeds you already have.
```

**Problem Points** (3-4 bullet points):

- **Rebuying seeds**: You can't remember what you already own, so you buy duplicates at the store
- **Lost information**: Seed packets get mixed up, and you can't find planting depth or spacing when you need it
- **Wasted seeds**: You don't know which seeds are still viable, so old packets sit unused while you buy new ones
- **Complex tools**: Other apps force you to use garden planning and calendars you don't need—you just want to track your seeds

**Visual/Example** (if using images):

- Messy seed box photo (before)
- Organized inventory screenshot (after)

---

### Solution Section

**Section Headline**:

```
Simple Seed Organizer: Just your seeds, nothing else.
```

**Value Proposition**:

```
The simplest way to track your seed collection. Store seed information, find it quickly, and know which seeds to use first—all on your phone.
```

**Key Features** (3-4 points):

1. **Quick Inventory**: Add seeds in seconds. Just name, variety, and source. Add details later if you want.
2. **Instant Search**: Find any seed in under 10 seconds. Search by name, variety, or category.
3. **Use-First List**: See which seeds are expiring soon, so you use them before they go bad.
4. **Mobile-First**: Access your seed info anywhere—at the store, in the garden, or when planning.

**What Makes It Different**:

- ✅ **No garden planning**—just seed inventory
- ✅ **No calendars**—no planting schedules or reminders
- ✅ **No design tools**—no plot planning or layouts
- ✅ **Just seeds**—store info, find it fast, use it when needed
