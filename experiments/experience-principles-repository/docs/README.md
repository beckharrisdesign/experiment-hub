# Experience Principles Repository

A knowledge base repository for experience principles and best practices from large enterprise ecosystems.

## Core Concept

Principles are the core object, each containing:
- **Tags**: Categorization and searchability
- **Flavors**: Variations or contextual applications
- **Examples**: Real-world implementations
- **Patterns**: Reusable design patterns
- **Research Sources**: References and citations
- **Votes**: Designer upvoting/downvoting for scoring

## LLM Integration Features

### Content Ingestion
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Paste screenshots, LLM suggests principle/pattern names
- **Auto-Stubbing**: LLM generates initial descriptions and documentation stubs
- **Research Discovery**: LLM finds additional sources and associates them with principles
- **Related Discussions**: LLM discovers other ways people have talked about the principle

### Workflow
1. Paste screenshot or paste text
2. LLM suggests principle name and stubs in description
3. User reviews and refines
4. LLM searches for additional research sources
5. LLM finds related discussions and alternative perspectives
6. Content is ready for designer review and voting

## Goals (MVP - Lean First Version)

- Easy content ingestion from existing enterprise ecosystem guidelines
- LLM-assisted content creation and research discovery
- Export actionable, engineer-friendly content
- MCP integration to extend design team's reach
- Designer voting system for quality scoring

## Future Considerations

- **Design Review Integration**: Users can paste work and ask for review based on principles
- **IDE/Jira Integration**: Hotkey in Jira or IDE to get design review of current code against principles
- **Real-time Feedback**: Contextual design feedback while working
