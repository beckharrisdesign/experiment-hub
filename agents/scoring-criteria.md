# Experiment Scoring Criteria

This document defines the detailed scoring criteria for evaluating experiments on a 1-5 scale across five dimensions.

## Business Opportunity (B)

**Market potential and revenue opportunity**

- **5**: $1B+ TAM, clear path to $10M+ revenue, validated demand, strong market signals
- **4**: $500M+ TAM, clear path to $1M+ revenue, strong market indicators, good growth potential
- **3**: $100M+ TAM, path to $100K+ revenue, moderate market indicators, uncertain growth
- **2**: $10M+ TAM, uncertain revenue path, weak market indicators, limited growth potential
- **1**: <$10M TAM, unclear revenue path, minimal market indicators, very limited opportunity

## Personal Impact (P)

**Would I personally use/benefit from this?**

- **5**: Solves a daily problem I face, would use it constantly, strong emotional connection, addresses core personal need
- **4**: Solves a regular problem I face, would use it frequently, good personal connection, addresses important need
- **3**: Solves an occasional problem I face, would use it sometimes, moderate personal connection, addresses occasional need
- **2**: Solves a rare problem I face, would use it rarely, weak personal connection, addresses infrequent need
- **1**: No personal use case, no personal connection, wouldn't use it myself

## Competitive Advantage (C)

**Market competition and differentiation**

- **5**: First-mover advantage, unique approach/angle, defensible moat, minimal direct competition
- **4**: Clear differentiation, underserved niche, some defensible elements, limited competition
- **3**: Some differentiation, competitive but viable positioning, moderate competition
- **2**: Limited differentiation, highly competitive market, many similar solutions
- **1**: No meaningful differentiation, saturated market, established dominant players

## Platform Cost ($)

**Solo buildability with AI-assisted coding tools (like Cursor) and infrastructure complexity**

- **5**: Can build solo with Cursor/AI tools in <1 month, minimal infrastructure (static hosting, simple DB), very low ongoing costs (<$50/mo), well-documented tech stack
- **4**: Can build solo with Cursor/AI tools in 1-3 months, simple infrastructure (managed services, standard DB), low ongoing costs ($50-200/mo), familiar tech stack
- **3**: Can build solo with Cursor/AI tools in 3-6 months, moderate infrastructure (some custom services, moderate complexity), moderate ongoing costs ($200-500/mo), some learning curve
- **2**: Requires 6-12 months even with AI tools, complex infrastructure (custom services, integrations), high ongoing costs ($500-2000/mo), significant learning curve or requires expertise I don't have
- **1**: Requires 12+ months or team, very complex infrastructure (specialized systems, heavy integrations), very high ongoing costs ($2000+/mo), requires expertise I don't have and can't easily learn

**Note**: AI-assisted coding tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) can significantly reduce build time and complexity. If a project would be a 2-3 without AI tools but becomes feasible solo with AI assistance, it should be scored higher (3-4).

## Social Impact (S)

**Fun, joy, and whether the world needs this**

- **5**: Addresses critical need, serves underserved/underrepresented communities, high positive impact, brings joy/fulfillment, meaningful contribution
- **4**: Addresses important need, serves specific community well, good positive impact, brings satisfaction, worthwhile contribution
- **3**: Addresses moderate need, serves general audience, moderate positive impact, some value, neutral contribution
- **2**: Addresses minor need, limited positive impact, minimal value, questionable contribution
- **1**: No meaningful social impact, no clear benefit to others, purely commercial/self-serving
